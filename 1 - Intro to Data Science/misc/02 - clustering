SESSION 2: clustering

+ k-means algorithm
	1. randomly determine k points
	2. assign each observation to the closest k points, to form k clusters
	3. calculate means of each k cluster, then set that equal the new k points
	4. repeat 2 & 3 until convergence

+ determining optimal k
	- no dominant solution
	- some heuristics
		>> point of decreasing marginal returns
