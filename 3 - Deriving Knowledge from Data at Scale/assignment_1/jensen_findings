1. Read WineQuality.pdf.
	Done.

2. Use the RedWhiteWine.csv/arff file that is provided, and upload to Azure Machine Learning as a dataset (Note: If needed, remove the quality attribute, which you will not need for this assignment.)
	Done.

3. Build an experiment in Azure Machine Learning using Decision Trees or Logistic Regression.
	3-1. What is the percentage of correct classification results (using all attributes)?
	99.5%

	3-2. What is the percentage of correct classification results (using a subset of the attributes)?
		97.7%

	3-3. What is the AUC of your model?
		0.989

4. What is your best AUC that you can achieve?
	0.998

5. Which are the the minimum number of attributes? Why?
	2 is the minimum number of attributes; 'Total Sulfur Dioxide' and 'Chlorides'. When including only 'Total Sulfur Dioxide' (the most important feature as measured by permutation feature importance) the model falls below the 95% accuracy threshold with an accuracy of 91.8%.
