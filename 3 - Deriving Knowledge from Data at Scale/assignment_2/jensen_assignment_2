Assignment 2 - Decisions Trees and Classification 
UW Data Science Certification - Deriving Knowledge from Data at Scale
Josh Jensen


 
In this problem we will use historical data from past customer responses to build a classification model. In class next week we will apply the trained model to a new set of prospects to whom we may want extend an offer for a PEP. Rather than doing a mass marketing campaign to all new prospects, we would like to target those that are likely to respond positively to our offer (according to our classification model).

1.  Use 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate your model accuracy. 
	Done.

2.  Spend time experimenting with different setting for the tree, such as pruning, etc. to see if you can improve the performance of your model. 
	Done.

3.  Review the structure of the tree, note the more important features and information that Weka is providing about the structure of the tree. 
	Done.

4.  Examine the performance measures that the tool provides, review lecture notes if you are unsure what these measure are. 
	Done.

5.  Generate the ROC curve for your final model
	Done.

6.  Record the final decision tree and model accuracy statistics obtained from your model. Be sure to indicate the parameters you use in building your classification model.
	Done.

7.  You should also generate and create a screen shot of your tree by selecting the "Visualize tree" command from the same menu.
	Done.
